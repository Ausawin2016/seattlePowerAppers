Search for things like \u201c2018 UI / UX awards\u201d etc. Really try to find the most inspiring apps out there.<br />- Then screenshot them.<br />- Choose one that fits your idea for a particular app.<br />- Upload the image to your app via File/Media/Browser.<br />- Insert an Image Control and set the Image Property to the screenshot you saved to the app.<br />- Stretch the screenshot and size ir right.<br />- Trace the elements you want to emulate using the shape Icons, dropdown controls, labels, etc.<br />- You don\u2019t necessarily have to use a Form control to build forms in PowerApps. It is possible to manually wire up the UI elements into a more flexible layout.<br />- The major benefits of the Form control are speed and error handling. You can slap in a 40 question Form in a minute using a Form control. That would take you 30 minutes to create manually. Also Forms can access Parent.Error and the other Error Properties that aren\u2019t exposed in non-Form controls. This built in logic can be painful to build and maintain manually.<br />- Also forms have the SubmitForm() function which can be quite a challenge to duplicate with Patch().<br />- If you don\u2019t want to wire up your own form, consider using \u201csub forms\u201d throughout your app. Basically having multiple Form controls using the same Data Source. This can compartmentalize your screens a bit more so it\u2019s not just a big gangly form.<br />- I would also love to see more examples of PowerApps Form UI/UX. Let\u2019s put some up in the Community Gallery!"

Here are some ideas that may help debug your issue:<\/p><ol><li>Ensure all your comparisons are correct.<ol><li>Put some debugging labels in your app that show the status of your comparisons.<\/li><li>Example: Create a label with Text Property set to IsBlank(DataCardValue23). Make sure its accurate. Repeat this for all your comparisons.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>I've found quite few times that things are not always cut and dry with IsBlank. Depending on how you setup your options or the type of control, you may need to use = \" \" or IsEmpty.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Also &lt; and &gt; comparisons can get weird when you are converting things to Text then Value(), etc.<\/li><li>Another idea is to put debug Gallery on the screen with its Items set to the LoadData() Collection. This will tell you what the data is on your mobile phone. It can be tricky to debug Load/SaveData() without this.<\/li><\/ol><p>Good luck!<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>"

You can use the RIGHT side \"Properties\" area OR you can use the Properties dropdown in the top LEFT.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>When you use the LEFT side Properties to control X and Y, you actually SET the Data Card position within your form. This is a very little known fact I think. For SINGLE column forms, you will only adjust the X value in the LEFT Properties dropdown.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><ul><li>0 = the first Data Card in your single column form<\/li><li>1 = the second Data Card in your single column form<\/li><li>etc.<\/li><\/ul><p>Try it out. Which ever card you want \"on top\", change its X property to 0 and watch it \"jump\" to the top. Repeat all the way through your form to aling the form the way you want.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>If you have a 2, 3, or 4 column form, you'll need to start using the Y Property to ontrol Data Card positions throughout your rows.<\/p><p><br />Example:<\/p><ul><li>A data card in the top left corner will have an X value of \"0\" and a Y value of \"0\".<\/li><li>A data card to the right of this first card will have an X value of \"1\" and a Y value of \"0\"<\/li><li>A data card to the right of this second card will have an X value of \"2\" and a Y value of \"0\"<\/li><li>This would result in a row of 3 data cards in a line<\/li><li>The second row would have a first data card with X value of \"0\" and a Y value of \"1\"<\/li><li>The data card to the right of this card would have an X value of \"1\" and a Y value of \"1\"<\/li><li>The data card to the right of this card would have an X value of \"2\" and a Y value of \"1\"<\/li><li>etc.<\/li><\/ul><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It takes a while to get used to and if you want to place cards LATER it is a serious pain to adjust cards this way, but it is the best way I've found.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Key points to remember:<\/p><p>* This ONLY works with the Properties Dropdown in the Top Left. If you use the X and Y properties on the RIGHT, you will not have the same results.
