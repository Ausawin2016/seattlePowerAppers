## Agenda

- Set up the ideal PowerApps development environment
- Select and define a real business problem
- Flesh out screens
- Create data tables

## Specifics

- Approach:
    - Option1: 
        - Work on app collectively during Meetup sessions
        - App is exported and shared with everyone at end of each session
        - Each user imports latest version of app
        - NOTE: Everyone will need their own services
            - If SQL chosen, you'll need Azure
            - If Sharepoint chosen, you'll need O365 Premium
    - Option2:
        - Work on apps individually during Meetup sessions
        - Apps remain in each users own environment
        - NOTE: Same services as above required
    - Option3:
        - Work from a centralized environment (@PowerApps.Rocks)
        - Everyone is an "owner" of their own app
        - Risky from a trust perspective
        - Everyone will need to pony up ~$30 / month
        - On-boarding new folks will be a challenge
