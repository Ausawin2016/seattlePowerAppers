## Introduction

Seattle PowerAppers Steve and Yvonne had some great ideas at our last Meetup:

- "Do some YouTube-style videos"
- "Post a sample app in the Github repo"
- "Give us a challenge to complete before the next event"
- "We can come together and go over how we solved the challenges"

I hear ya! To keep things dynamic and expose our Meetup Group to some new PowerApps concepts, we're going to build an app-in-a-Meetup that determines if that shaking feeling was indeed an earthquake or not. 

**Here we go...SHAAAAKKKIIINNGGG Things Up!!**
