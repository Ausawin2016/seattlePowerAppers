## Agenda

- Set up the ideal PowerApps development environment
- Select and define a real business problem
- Find screen inspiration
- Create data some tables

## Specifics

### Approach:

- Option 1: 
    - Work on app collectively during Meetup sessions
    - App is exported and shared with everyone at end of each session
    - Each user imports latest version of app
    - NOTE: Everyone will need their own services
        - If SQL chosen, you'll need Azure
        - If Sharepoint chosen, you'll need O365 Premium
- Option 2:
    - Work on apps individually during Meetup sessions
    - Apps remain in each users own environment
    - NOTE: Same services as above required
- Option 3:
    - Work from a centralized environment (@PowerApps.Rocks)
    - Everyone is an "owner" of their own app
    - Risky from a trust perspective
    - Everyone will need to pony up ~$30 / month
    - On-boarding new folks will be a challenge
- Other?
